# Churn Prediction 
I partnered with the CEO of a Private Equity backed dental practice with the understanding that:

  Business  +  Data Science  =  Better Business

  To that end I agreed to the following deliverbales for his practice:  
  
  1. Build a patient churn prediction model with the following specs: 
  
    - Predictions based solely on patient charateristics (i.e. not based on time to their next appointment)
    - Predictions are deployed within staff daily worksflow, thereby allowing them to take a proactive action to prevent churn. 
    
  2. Build a prioritized patient contact list (customer segmentation) for patients who do churn:  
  
    - List must be deployed into staff daily workflow to allow them to take action on contacting inactive patients in a prioritized fashion.
