I partnered with the CEO of a Private Equity backed dental practice with the understanding that:  
  <p align='center'>
  Business  +  Data Science  =  Better Business
  </p>
  <br>
  To that end I agreed to the following deliverables for his practice:  
  
  1. Build a patient churn prediction model with the following specs:  
  - Predictions based solely on patient characteristics (i.e. not based on time to patient's next appointment)  
  - Predictions are deployed within staff daily worksflow, thereby allowing them to take a proactive action to prevent churn. 
    
  2. Build a prioritized patient contact list (customer segmentation) for patients who do churn:   
  - List must be deployed into staff daily workflow to allow them to take action on contacting inactive patients in a prioritized fashion.  
  
## The Data
I had access to the entire practices data which was housed in a mySQL database, comprising over 300 tables.  Only a handful were relevant to this particular project, 
among which were the following tables:
